            Me and some of my friends went camping for a few days. The trip was very fun.
            We had a great time fishing, relaxing and bathing. We even met other campers. 
            This was one of the most memorable moments in the summer vacation.

            We got invited home to a friend. We had a fun time there. He made the burger before we came. 
            Too bad he didnt clean his house before we came. You should have seen his refrigerator. 
            It was covered in mold.

            Went to Jafs  R책holt for some lunch. 
            They served a great nachoburger with some fries at the side. 
            It tasted great and I got lucky and didnt get a used band-aid in my burger, 
            like my friend did.

            One of us in the group was in a cave! It was very deep and at the start of
            the cave there was a small waterfall.
