<p>When creating the flexbox we struggled many hours on how to make the picture align itself centered in the middle of each container. But wrapping 
    it araound a div and using text-align fixed the problem. Then we struggled on how to make the pictures resize relative to the screensize. We knew 
    that using @media and max-width to mobile screen size we could make the pictures sized realtive to the screen size. The problem was when shrinking the 
    pictures from computerscreen
    size to mobile screensize. It would make the right pictures dissapear until the media funkction kicked in at a bout 768px.</p>
