<p>We started off this project by making the wireframe in Figma. We just found some simple videos on youtube on how to make a wireframe. 
    The wireframe part went pretty easy, but when we were gonna implement the it problems kept appearing. We were also wondering wich way 
    we wanted to display the pictures, but ended up with flexbox. When creating the flexbox we struggled many hours on how to make the picture 
    align itself centered in the middle of each container. But wrapping it araound a div and using text-align fixed the problem. Then we struggled 
    on how to make the pictures resize relative to the screensize. We knew that using @media and max-width to mobile screen size we could make the 
    pictures sized realtive to the screen size. The problem was when shrinking the pictures from the computerscreen size to mobile screensize. It 
    would make the right pictures dissappear until the media query kicked in at about 768px. Since we used bigger screens like 27 inch the ratio 
    was so bad on regular computerscreens. Since the usual computerscreen is about 1300-1400px wide we made a media query that made the pictures 
    width smaller so it would fit the screen much better if it went down lower than 1280px. We also made one media query as said for mobile. 
    When it went below 768px in width the flexbox direction was switched to column and the picture width was lowered to fit the screen.
